# AndrewBaritone

AndrewBaritone is a customized version of the [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone) project, specifically only for Fabric

This project is currently intended for **Minecraft 1.21.1**

## Features
- You can actually compile the project (literally couldn't compile Baritone)
- Merged fixes from the 1.19.4 branch

## Note
I did remove the test files because couldn't get Junit to work.

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/andrew121410/andrewbaritone.git
    cd andrewbaritone
    ```

2. **Build the project:**
    ```sh
    ./gradlew build
    ```

3. **Install the mod:**
